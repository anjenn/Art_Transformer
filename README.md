# Artistic Style Transfer with Deep Learning
This project applies deep learning to transform my photos into the style of my own artwork.
It started as a way to experiment with building a CNN from scratch while also exploring how different models handle style transfer.

# What I Tried:
Custom CNN Model – Built a basic convolutional network to understand the fundamentals of style transfer.
VGG-19 Pre-trained Model – Used a well-known deep learning model for better feature extraction and more refined results.
Single vs. Multiple Training Images – Tested how using one vs. multiple style images affects the outcome.

# Challenges & Takeaways:
Finding the right balance between speed, detail, and realism in the generated images.
Comparing model complexity, batch size, and learning rate to optimize results.
Seeing firsthand how different architectures impact the quality of the transformation.
